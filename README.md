The **Catch A Flight** project is an in-depth exploration of best-in-class software engineering practices within 
the Java and Spring Boot ecosystem, harnessing **JDK 24** and **Spring Boot 3** to deliver scalable, modular, 
and resilient systems. It focuses on two distinct architectural variants—**Modular Monolith** and **Microservices**—
to demonstrate flexible, real-world solutions. The project emphasizes:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Event Storming** for precise domain modeling.
- **Hexagonal Architecture** to ensure modularity and loose coupling.
- **Event-Driven Design** with **Async Messaging** for responsive, dynamic systems.
- **Cloud Design Patterns** to support scalable, distributed architectures in the microservices variant.
- **Comprehensive API capabilities**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC, Server-Side Events, and WebSockets.
- **Robust persistence options**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2) and NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, InfluxDB, Neo4j).
- **Full observability** through advanced logging, monitoring, and tracing.
- **Sophisticated deployment strategies**, including Rolling Upgrades, Blue-Green, and Canary deployments.

The **Modular Monolith** variant prioritizes simplicity and cohesion, while the **Microservices** variant leverages 
Kubernetes, API management, and event streaming (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ) for distributed, cloud-native systems.
